# ENSAE_CycleGAN

This assignment gives a brief bibliographical review in both papers of the DC-GAN and
the Wasserstein GAN, and then summarizes a more advanced architecture that combines two
GANs the CycleGAN. The second part of this paper to describe in short the implementation of
CycleGAN and result in using this GAN in translating images from the MNIST dataset to the
USPS dataset.
